# Gallery with User Registration System

This project is a **web-based gallery application** developed as part of a Computer Science course. It focuses on implementing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture** in **PHP**, integrating **MongoDB** for database management, and using **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality. The application allows users to register, log in, upload photos, and save their favorite photos to a "cart."

   - Passwords are securely hashed for storage.

2. **Photo Upload**:
   - Users can upload photos to the gallery to share them with others.
   - Uploaded photos are stored in the database and displayed in the gallery.

3. **Save to Favorites**:
   - Users can save their favorite photos by adding them to their "cart."
   - Similar to an online shopping cart, users can view and manage their saved photos.
